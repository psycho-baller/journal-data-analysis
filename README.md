# Journal Data Analysis

## TODO

- [ ] get the avg score for each day and do some analysis on how it differs from my overall score
- [X] more correlation analysis (sleep, music, etc)

## Findings

- My overall day score is strongly correlated with my happiness score(.89), the big Q is what is my criteria for happiness? Honestly didn't see that happening
- My sleep duration is NEGATIVELY correlated(-.17) with my overall day score, which is very interesting. Can't confirm that the data is not skewed yet
- So I decided to analyze my sleep duration correlations, turns out my it's slightly positively correlated with my 'living in the moment' score(.19), excitement(.17), stress(.12), energy(.086). Nothing strong but yeah
- Interesting, so my energy score has a slight positive correlation with minutes asleep and sleep score (.24). And it also has a .6 correlation with health and .53 with overall score.ðŸ¤”

### 2023

- Happiness correlates with productivity with a score of .85
- Purpose correlates most with productivity (expected) and happiness (on first thought it doesn't make sense, but thinking bout it, it does)
